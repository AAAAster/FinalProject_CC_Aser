# FinalProject_CC_Aser
Hi, this is Aster's final project for CreativeCoding 2022 spring.

Name of this project is _**Ideation Sketchpad**_


Inspired by painting, I wanted to make a conceptual drawing board that could change over time. The elements in the drawing board are no longer a single line, a simple figure. It's a conceptual drawing board replaced by different elements.

Users can draw different shapes by selecting different shapes as the base. The graphics are constantly changing without the control of the artist. Of course, the painter can also use the "time tool" to define the graphics to be drawn.

Starry sky? Or the dazzling Milky Way? Can be drawn in different mouse switches.
