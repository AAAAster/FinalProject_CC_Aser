**Final Self Assessment By Aster Wang**

**- Critically analyze/evaluate:** as I am studying python, JS and C++ at the same time, I have considerable pressure in this semester. And learning three languages with different structures at the same time is even more of an ordeal. One of the biggest problems I faced in the learning process was the confusion caused by the grammatical structure of different languages.
Many of the statements and syntax in Python do not work in JS, which affects my ability to write code. And the P5JS code base and JS are not common, so the opportunity to get online help becomes even less. I hope the P5JS library can be better improved. Such as code example and explanation and so on.
As far as I am concerned, I spend 4-6 hours in the course of Creative Coding every week. I would like to see more improvements in code quality.


**- Comment on my successes:** BETWEEN Processing and P5JS, I prefer Processing, because Processing has more databases for searching code usage and learning. I don't have a lot of frustration in Processing. All problems encountered can be solved through the library on the official website. My biggest success in this process was to learn how to use the official website inspection code case. In the learning process of P5JS, I encountered many difficulties, such as the definition of function and function and how to use it. You can't find a very detailed introduction on the official website. But P5JS is much more practical. In the second half of this semester, I mainly focused on P5JS.


**- Compare and contrast OOP versus Procedural Programming:** I love OOP but don't want to use it in a simple project. OOP can wrap a series of functions as functions that a programmer can easily call. But for simple projects, this is an increase in work and a decrease in efficiency. I think programming is about solving complex problems in the simplest way possible. My idea of OOP is to encapsulate countless functions into a function and then call it in place. More complex projects can be of great help.


**- Specifically considering your final project:** AT the very beginning of the project I wanted to do a jump game with 3D motion effects. When the user presses down on the keyboard, the avatar becomes smaller, similar to when the user presses down on pressure and receives feedback. If done correctly, the avatar can loop through the map indefinitely. But when I actually started the project I found it difficult. 1: If building a map that runs indefinitely becomes difficult. I learned a lot of information online, and according to the reference code to construct a new code to achieve infinite map function. But I didn't have the ability to construct my own code so I gave up on the idea. A finite map is generated using an array generation method. After giving up this project, I started a new project called "Concept Sketchboard". I looked through a lot of literature and found that there were many similar works on the Internet. I was worried about repetition so I went back to the production of "Jump". In the process of making this game also encountered a lot of problems. I also learned a lot of practical skills from it.

**- Think specifically about your final project: **Throughout the process I learned how to look up information and learn problem-solving ideas from previous work.

**- What milestones do I expect? :** The initial milestone of my project was a very polished game with credits, sound effects, 3D animation, etc. But I had to change my plan in the face of reality. There are several milestones in the final project design. 1. Complete the generation of random map. 2. Make the character move according to the length of the keyboard click. 3. Collision detection is implemented. 4. Complete the dynamic effect of compression when pressing.


**- What are you most proud of about your final project? :** What I am most proud of in the final project is my attitude towards problems. The code THAT I had spent a week learning and improving was abandoned overnight. Because at that time I realized the importance of original code, I must be able to complete every function by myself, rather than borrowing others' work. I rewrote all the programs in one night.



**- How do you think you will continue programming:** I will learn more about programming in the future. I plan to improve my programming ability through practical cases, such as finishing the final version of this project in my spare time during the summer vacation. Add various effects as well as beautify the UI design and improve the map functionality. And more open source projects will be completed with hardware in the future.
